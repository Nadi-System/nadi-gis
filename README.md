# NADI (Network Analysis and Data Integration) GIS Tool


# Installation
## Binary
`nadi` binary can be installed using the rust ecosystem, or the `makepkg` command in Arch Linux.

To compile the program, run `cargo build --release`, and then you'll have the `nadi` binary in the `target/release` folder. Copy that to your `PATH`. Also, you'll probably need shared libraries for `gdal`
